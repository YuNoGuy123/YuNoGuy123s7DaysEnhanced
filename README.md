# YuNoGuy123's 7 Days to Die Enhanced
#### A mod for 7 Days to Die that focuses more on improving the things that are already in the game rather than adding large amounts of new content.


Current short term goals:
- Improve spawning of late-game enemies
- Improve base game balance [Make strength less overpowered, make fortitude better.]
- Add some general QOL features [Bigger stack sizes, Bigger inventory]


Current long term goals:
- Improve trader item pools [No more day 1 tactical rifles]
- Improve loot spawning
- Make late game harder
- EXP gain rework



This project is done entirely on my own free time, but I really do love 7 Days to Die so I am working hard to make sure that it works well, and I am really passionate about improving issues that exist in the game.
